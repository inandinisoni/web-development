    <h1 >ABOUT CSS CASCADE AND SPECIFICITY</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascade style sheet . Cascade is an algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules are
        applied to an HTML element</p>
    <p>Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element
        and therefore will be applied.</p>
    <p>Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector
        type in the matching selector. When multiple declarations have equal specificity, the last declaration found in
        the CSS is applied to the element.</p>

    <h2>Specificity Hierarchy</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Inline styles - 1000</p>
        <p>ID - 100</p>
        <p>Class, pseudo-class, attribute - 10</p>
        <p>Element, pseudo-element - 1</p>
        <p>Universal selector - 0</p>
        <b class="precedence">Inline CSS > ID selector > Class or attribute selector > Element selector > Universal
            Selector </b>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
        <h2>!important </h2>
        It is important to note that the <b> !important </b>declaration will override the normal specificity hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>For example, if you have a style defined for a paragraph element with an ID of #special, and you add the
            !important declaration to the style that is defined for the .special class, the style that is defined for
            the
            .special class will take precedence over the style that is defined for the ID.</p>
        <p>It is generally best to avoid using the !important declaration, as it can make it difficult to override
            styles later on in your CSS.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Position and order of apppearance</h2>
    <p>When two selectors have the same specificity, the last one defined will take precedence.</p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>If you havent applied any style in your css the browser will have its own <i>User Agent Stylesheet</i> which will be
        applied if no css is present and we write out own css it will overwrite browsers.</p>
